Design considerations
=====================

Notes anbout the assignment
---------------------------

There are some errors:

* There is no JOBS link on the home page. One must go via FOR CANDIDATES

* The text search is fuzzy. If one searches for "Chief", the results include
jobs that contain words similar to "Chief" (like "Owner"). Implementing a
test for such a search requires that one is informed of what the engine
considers to be similar to "Chief".

I will note that the testability of the crossover web site leaves something to
be desired. Most of the web elements do not come with an id property so one
must jump through some serious hoops.

General implementation
----------------------

This is ultimately a relatively straight forward maven project implementation.
The only delicate thing is implementing the acceptance tests using
the robot framework maven plugin. Additionally, I've included a plugin that
checks for the latest web driver binaries and downloads them if needed.

Handling the Javascript libraries on the web site
-------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, a lot of web elements on www.crossover.com do not have an
id property.
I've handled this by embedding Javascript code in the robot test cases. The
Javascript code identifies such web elements using other properties and
then assigns them unique id property values.

Resolving the issue of the fuzzy text search
--------------------------------------------

I've assumed that a minimum of fully matching results would constitute a
PASS. The threshold is configurable via the ${minMatches} variable in
src/test/robotframework/settings/Settings.robot file.
A proper test case will depend on how the search is implemented.

docker notes
------------

The only remarcable (for me) issue here is the use of xvfb such that headless
selenium tests can be executed in docker containers.

Personal notes
--------------

This was a very challenging assignment for me. Maven, Selenium, and the
Robot framework are all technologies that I had never used before and I would
like to thank you for the opportunity.
